          <p>Intel ideation camp was a great success. Students were given three topics; they were solid waste management, preservation of Indian monuments and crowdsourcing. Participants had to select one problem related to one topic and provide a solution to the problem at the end of day two they prepared and presented a business plan for their solution. Team MIB is happy with the way students approached the topics and built a reasonable business plan, we are happier with the fact that one of the teams has decided to continue working with the idea good luck to them. Special thanks to all the mentors who came up with incredible topics and for helping the teams with their business plans.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">The 3E's</a></h3>
          
          <p>It is often said in India people first become engineers and then decide what they want to do next. Isn't it great to know all the options before taking the leap of faith? MIB is offering just that with its first event aimed to bring all the three eventual career choices- employment, entrepreneurship and education into one scope. If you want our experts to discuss your queries feel free to drop it with your contact info at "bvbctie@gmail.com", also you can raise questions after the dialogues. The program format is 'panel discussion' - one hour, followed by Q&A for 30 minutes.
Discussion panel:
On Employment - Mr. Chidambar Joshi, General Manager, IBM 
On Entrepreneurship -Mr. Gaurav Shah, Founder of Seven Beans
On Higher Education - Prof. G. D. Kamalapur, SDM CET, Dharwad
The talk is on Sunday the 9th Nov at 10.30 am. ( BT AUDITORIUM )
Next time you are asked "what u want to do after engineering"? you have an answer and not silence which echoes uncertainty.</p>

              <p>It was completely an interactive session with a question and answer atmosphere. Real life examples of successful products and achievers made the session more interesting. Then, we learnt about entrepreneurship and the critical building blocks of entrepreneurship. It was really an amazing class as innovative teaching methods like showing animated videos to make us understand a concept, showing inspirational videos etc., were used. Also, the reading material given well before the commencement of the program helped us in understanding the concepts in a better way. Afternoon session basically involved a group activity which made us to identify a problem along with a suitable solution.</p>
